# sgame
Some one-day-will-be-a-game thing I tinker with when bored.

The end goal is to make something like Commandos, because that game was damn epic. Currently playing around with collision detection and pathing stuff.

Has some sort of Lua game controller and entity system (very rough at this point). The beginnings of a GUI also make an appearance. Maps are made using Tiled, the map graphics came from some free source, the epic entity sprites I drew myself in GIMP. 

Builds with CMake, has project files for CLion IDE.
